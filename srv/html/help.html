    Welcome to springwhiz, a free webapplication that gives you some tools
    to enhance your browsing experience. It is your personal start page
    with quick access to favorites and other fun stuff.
</p>
<p>
    You can search the web using the very great duckduckgo.com search engine
    by entering you search string right now.
    If you prefix your query with an '@' or '#' symbol, springwhiz will
    run a command or browse to a favorite respectively.
</p>
<p>
    If the prefix is not found your query will be send directly to
    duckduckgo.com<br>
    This means you can use the awesome !bang syntax duckduckgo offers to
    search on hundreds of sites directly.
</p>
